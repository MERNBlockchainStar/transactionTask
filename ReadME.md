In the provided solution, I have used SOLID and GRASP principles along with some design patterns to ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase. Here's a description of the patterns and principles used:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain. For example, the Account class is responsible for managing account information, while the Transaction classes handle different types of transactions.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The code is open for extension but closed for modification. For example, you can easily add new types of transactions by extending the Transaction class without modifying the existing transaction classes or the AccountManager class.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Derived classes can be substituted for their base classes without affecting the correctness of the program. For example, you can use any class derived from Transaction in the AccountManager class without any issues.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The solution does not use any interfaces, but if needed, you can create small and focused interfaces to ensure that clients only need to know about the methods that are relevant to them.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The solution uses dependency injection to decouple the high-level 
AccountManager class from the low-level Account and Transaction classes. This makes the code more flexible and easier to test.

Creator Pattern (GRASP): The AccountManager class acts as a creator for the Account and Transaction objects, managing their creation and relationships.

Controller Pattern (GRASP): The AccountManager class acts as a controller, coordinating the actions between the Account and Transaction classes.

Factory Method Pattern: Although not explicitly used in the solution, you can easily implement a factory method to create different types of transactions based on input parameters.

Strategy Pattern: The different types of transactions (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer) can be seen as different strategies for performing financial operations. By using the Transaction base class and its derived classes, you can easily switch between different transaction strategies without modifying the AccountManager class.
